EminemNN: Comparing neural network models for rap lyric generation. 
NLU project by Phoebe Pinney and Jorgen Jensvold. This project aims to compare two models for generating unique rap lyrics that are recognisably in the usual style and structure of Eminem. It compares the results of a simple RNN to a transformer model.


REPOSITORY ORGANISATION

 - DATA
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle, uploaded by Thaddeus Segura (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaddeussegura/eminem-lyrics-from-all-albums).  It consists of a dataset of Eminem's entire discography - the file "ALL_eminem.txt" in the dataset contains all 223 of Eminem's songs combined into one text file - this is the data used for training. All lyrics are in English and have been sourced from free lyric hosting websites.

 - NOTEBOOKS
This project repository contains 4 notebooks: a notebook for the training of each model, a notebook for the quantitative analysis, and a notebook for the live demo.

- RAPS
Two raps, one generated by each model with the same prompt, have been included in this repo. These generated raps were used for the quantitative analysis.


SIMPLE RNN MODEL

The simple RNN was implemented using the Keras library. It has an embedding layer, dropout layer, and a SimpleRNN layer followed by a dense output layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. It has been saved to Google drive and can be accessed via this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ftcp-jARuLlVdFA3ugI8efCYfCdCj7en/view?usp=share_link. 

The code for generating the lyrics using the model was inspired by the following Kaggle notebook by Yassmen Youssef: https://www.kaggle.com/code/yassmenyoussef/song-lyrics-generator-rnn-gru-lstm#Generating-A-Song.


TRANSFORMER MODEL

The transformer model is a HuggingFace GPT-2 transformer that has been trained and fine-tuned on the Eminem discography. The model can be accessed in Google Drive via this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-4KJn8HqoI_y7Diezi2I-BOUEJQU9MTp?usp=share_link.

The code pertaining to the fine-tuned transformer can be attributed to: https://github.com/sfs0126/Lyric-Generator-fine-tuned-GPT-2. To generate lyrics using the model, a python file is needed, which can be accessed at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bnIWGtye4XkzGY8sakUGMuF_9LKm6b-C/view?usp=share_link. To re-train the model, another python file is needed, which can be accessed at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OhtD0N6nOK_Ic6bpCf4R4v0BHWZQ_nCv/view?usp=share_link.
