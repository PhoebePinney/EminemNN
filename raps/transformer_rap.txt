I am a legend in my own way, a symbol of my people
And I am a legend in my own way, a symbol of my people 
Come up now, we're in trouble 
But if you need the strength of an artist, let yourself go 
I got a lot of respect for rappers, but I'm not afraid of rap's dominance
My attitude is just one of my goals, my motto is Fuck you And you're never gonna get it 
I'm so good I just wanna get it (Fuck you) 
Bitch, I got a thing for you (You're crazy)  
You ain't gonna give me nothing, you'll never get it 
If I go to school with kids that I don't know 
Just so you know 
Just so you know 
I'm the star of the show, I'm the star of the show 
I'm the star of the show I'm the star of the show 
'Cause all I did was play the part of the devil in front
